<section>
In large companies with many employees, finding the optimal project that promotes
professional development and perfectly matches individual expectations has always
been a challenge. Even when a suitable project is found, the traditional emailing back
and forth to exchange general information can be time and effort-consuming for both
employees and managers. 
</section>

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
CapSearch offers an innovative solution to this complexity. By digitizing the process,
Capsearch streamlines how employees are matched with projects. Instead of relying on
manual, inefficient methods, Capsearch uses a robust Embedding-based
Recommender System that suggests the best job opportunities for each employee. This
algorithm takes into account various factors such as the employee&#39;s skills and project
requirements, ensuring an ideal fit that supports both the employee&#39;s career
development and the company&#39;s needs.
